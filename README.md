Mobitra - Telkom Mobile LTE Data Usage Tracker
==============================================

Mobitra is a Windows desktop application that tracks Telkom Mobile prepaid LTE data usage
over Huawei LTE routers (e.g. B618). It aims to provide more finer grained data usage
reports and charts (e.g. total data downloaded and uploaded on a daily basis) than the
official Telkom site and mobile app, where only the total data usage and balances
are reported. This gives prepaid LTE uses better insight in their data usage patterns.

## Requirements and Planned Features:

- Dock to system tray at Windows start-up.
- System tray tool tip shows the current monthly download and upload stats.
- On the main application screen, show the:
    - Monthly download and upload stats
    - Current download and upload stats (refreshes automatically)
    - Bar chart of monthly download and upload stats for finer-grained time periods.
    - Cummulative line chart of download and upload stats with an upper limit line representing the data cap
    - Show the prepaid bundle expiry date
    - Separate charts per prepaid bundle (normal bundle data allocation vs. night-time surfer data allocation)
